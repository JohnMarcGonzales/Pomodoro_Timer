## Code Structure

- **Constants:**
  - `THEMES` and `LIMITS` define the look and allowed durations for each timer type.
- **PomodoroApp class:**
  - Handles all timer logic, UI, and history.
  - **State:** `self.state` is 'pomodoro', 'short', or 'long'.
  - **Durations:** `self.durations` holds the current durations for each timer.
  - **Counters:** `self.counters` tracks the current session; `self.history` is loaded/saved from `history.json`.
  - **UI:** Built in `build_ui()`, with all controls and labels clearly named.
  - **Timer Logic:** `start_timer`, `pause_timer`, `reset_timer`, `skip_timer`, `exit_app`, and `handle_cycle_end` manage the timer and state transitions.
  - **Popups:** `show_popup` ensures notifications are always on top.
  - **Window Centering:** `center_window` keeps the app centered on launch.
  - **History:** Automatically saved on close and loaded on start.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Customization
- Change theme colors or emojis in the `THEMES` dictionary.
- Adjust allowed duration ranges in the `LIMITS` dictionary.
- All variable names and logic are kept simple and commented for easy editing.
